        "Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental pillars of OOP, and it refers to the bundling of data(attributes) and the methods(functions) that operare on that data into a single unit called an object. The key idea is to encapsulate or enclose the data and methods related to an entity or concept into a single cohesive unit.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some benefits in encapsulation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Data Hiding: It allows you to hide the internal implementation details of an object from external code. From the example on the platform, the attributes `name` and `age` are encapsulated within the `Player` class. External code can access them only through the defined methods (`run` and `speak`), making it easier to control and protect the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Code Organization: Encapsulation organizes code logically. Data and methods that are closely related are grouped together within the same class, making the code more maintainable and readable.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Modularity: Objects encapsulate their functionality, making it easier to reuse code in different parts of a program or in different programs altogether.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Security: Encapsulation can provide a level of security by controlling access to data. You can define access control (e.g., public, private, protected) to restrict or allow access to specific attributes or methods."
